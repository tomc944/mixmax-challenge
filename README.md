# mixmax-challenge

I'm an avid outdoorsman and I commonly share climbing routes with my friends.

Mountain project is the go-to site of choice for finding out beta (technial information)
about routes, location, and any other random information. I decided to make
a quick link resolver for this purpose.

You can check it out in development by running npm install and npm start.
